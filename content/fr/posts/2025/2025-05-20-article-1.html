    <p>  <br>What is Lorem Ipsum? <br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <br> typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard  <br>dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley  <br>of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived  <br>not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,  <br>remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with  <br>the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more <br> recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker  <br>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>  <p>Why do we use it? <br>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br> readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of  <br>using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of  <br>letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it  <br>look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web  <br>page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a  <br>search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their  <br>infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by  <br>accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>  <p>Where does it come from? <br>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It <br> has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making  <br>it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at  <br>Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure  <br>Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through  <br>the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the  <br>undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  <br>of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by  <br>Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of  <br>ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem  <br>Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section  <br>1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br> reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  <br>from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in  <br>their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 <br> translation by H. Rackham.</p>  <p>Where can I get some? <br>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but  <br>the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,  <br>or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you  <br>are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there  <br>isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem  <br>Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as  <br>necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses <br> a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model  <br>sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The <br> generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,  <br>injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
